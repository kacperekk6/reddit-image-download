# RedditImageDownloader ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“¸

Welcome to RedditImageDownloader, a simple Python module for effortlessly batch downloading media from Reddit! ðŸŒŸ

This tool leverages the Reddit API and the PRAW library to seamlessly fetch post information and download the corresponding images in async/await method. The script uses built-in md5-based duplicate removal for initial data cleaning purpose to avoid downloading the same image that was posted to multiple subreddits.

# Usage

## Preliminary

- clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kaledgar/RedditImageDownloader
```
- Create [`authorized reddit application`](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps), read about [`Reddit API`](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and obtain the necessary credentials, such as the client ID, client secret, username, password, and user agent. Store these credentials in a JSON file `credentials.json` in your local repository that you cloned.

```json
{
    "username": "your reddit username",
    "password": "pw to your reddit account",
    "user_agent": "anything here",
    "client_secret": "client secret of reddit app you create",
    "client_id": "app id, see below for details"
}
```

## Run the script

 - Customize the constants.py file if needed, adjusting default file paths or other constants according to your preferences.
 - Install the required dependencies:

```sh
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Check possible arguments
python3 -m reddit_image_downloader -h

# Run module with your custom arguments
python3 -m reddit_image_downloader -u example_user -d 'mnt/d/Downloads'
```

The last command runs the script and downloads media from users given in list and saves it in separate directories.
